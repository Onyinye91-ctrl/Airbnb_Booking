### Airbnb_Booking

I created an interactive Dashbord with **Tableau** using Airbnb dataset for New York city for the year **2019**. Airbnb is an online marketplace for short and long-term homestays and experiences. The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venkatreddykonasani/ab-nyc-2019csv). The dataset has **48895** rows and **16** columns.
